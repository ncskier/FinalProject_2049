# Picture Puzzle iOS Game

This was my final project for CS 2049: Intermediate iPhone Development. It is a puzzle game where players are presented with a picture, and they must find the location from where the picture was taken. Players can post and solve puzzles.

I used Firebase for the server back end and Realm for local back end, then CocoaPods for dependency management.
